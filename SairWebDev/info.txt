npm install axios react-router-dom redux react-redux redux-thunk redux-devtools-extension moment react-moment

axios for Http requests: better than http header as helps in creating global headers and stuff
react-router is required
redux-thunk allows us to make asynchronous requests in our actions
moment: date and time library
react-moment: so that we can use moment within the react components


We create a proxy: because we dont want to create an axios request with a full https address
we would want to call just by the route like : /app/something
therefore add proxy in package.json
